I am an android developer and computer science student at Rio de Janeiro State University.

I am looking to specialize in mobile. Currently, I only develop for android, but I have a great interest in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile with a plan to develop for ios in the future. 

Besides that, I also create some bots using python.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My first programming language was ActionScript 3.0 in 2013 when I cloned a game of my teacher. After that, I only got back to learning programming in 2018 when I got interested in python.
