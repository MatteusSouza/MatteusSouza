I am a computer science student at Rio de Janeiro State University.

I am looking to specialize in mobile. Currently, I only develop for android, but I have a great interest in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile with a plan to develop for ios in the future. 

Besides that, I also create some bots using python.
